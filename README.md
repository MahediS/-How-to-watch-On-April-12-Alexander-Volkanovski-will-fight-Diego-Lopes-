# -How-to-watch-On-April-12-Alexander-Volkanovski-will-fight-Diego-Lopes-

the main event of UFC 314 in between the Kaseya Centerin in Miami. The event's main event will be for the vacant UFC featherweight title after Ilia Topuria vacated the‚ÄÇtitle to go to lightweight. It‚Äôs a meaningful matchup for each of the‚ÄÇfighters: Volkanovski, 35, attempts to reclaim his former glory; Lopes, 28, seeks his first-ever UFC title.
Alexander Volkanovski's
Record and Recent Form: Volkanovski (26-4) is a former UFC featherweight‚ÄÇchampion who reigned for more than four years and five defenses. But he‚Äôs also coming off consecutive knockout losses ‚Äî first to‚ÄÇIslam Makhachev in October 2024 at lightweight and also to Ilia Topuria in February 2024 at featherweight. This‚ÄÇis his first fight in more than a year, 14 months of recovery time.
Motivations: Volkanovski is 36 years old and has said this may well be his‚ÄÇlast opportunity to win back the title. He has adopted an ‚ÄúOld Man Volk‚Äù persona, determined to show that he‚ÄÇstill belongs in the conversation with the best. He is still confident that‚ÄÇhis experience and tactical acumen will see him through against younger opponents.

Diego Lopes' Rise
Record and Momentum: Lopes (26-6) has won five in a row, including his wins over Dan Ige‚ÄÇand Brian Ortega. Famed for his all-action style and finishing ability, Lopes has fast emerged as one to watch at 145-pounds after joining the UFC ranks more than two‚ÄÇyears ago.
Fight Style: Lopes has brutal knockout power‚ÄÇand high-level jiu-jitsu skills, making him a dangerous foe both standing and on the mat. But questions on‚ÄÇhis cardio have remained in the atmosphere, although he looked to improve in his past several fights.
Victory
For Volkanovski: Specialists say that Volkanovski must depend on his footwork and tactical plan to‚ÄÇspend Lopes‚Äô cardio. Steering clear of early exchanges where Lopes is most dangerous will be‚ÄÇkey, especially since Volkanovski‚Äôs durability has been questioned following consecutive knockout losses.
For Lopes: Lopes should build on Volkanovski‚Äôs recent weaknesses by pressuring‚ÄÇhim from the early going and leveraging his power. His ability to blend striking with grappling could also‚ÄÇhave been problematic for Volkanovski.
Fight Highlights
But the‚ÄÇUFC 314 card is one of the deepest all year:
Co-Main Event: Michael Chandler vs.‚ÄÇPaddy Pimblett in a lightweight fight.
Other bouts of note: Yair Rodriguez vs.‚ÄÇPatricio Pitbull (featherweight), Jean Silva vs. Bryce Mitchell (featherweight), Geoff Neal vs. Carlos Prates (welterweight).
This matchup is a contrast of eras: the established prowess‚ÄÇand resume of Volkanovski against Lopes‚Äô youthful drive and quest for gold. The result will not only decide the‚ÄÇnext featherweight champion, but also could shape the future paths of both men as fighters.
